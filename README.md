# Tour and Travel Data Analysis
 An analysis on a tour and travel company's dataset. 
 
 This is one of the datasets I pulled for my Portfolio Builder class with Women in Data, but ended up going with a different dataset in the end. Once I got a better feel for EDA and the process of poking around at what a dataframe looks like, I decided to pick this up and poke around at it after all.
 
 The project in its entirety can be opened through Google Colab or Jupyter Notebooks. It is a basic analysis of the dataframe as well as some minor cleaning. 
 
 I am considering doing a model for this, but I don't want to do the same model I did for the Telecom Company Churn. Otherwise, it'll just become a customized analysis.
